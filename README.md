# FX4Sight
Introducing FX4Sight, your ultimate companion for mastering the forex and crypto markets. Unlock predictive insights and make informed trading decisions like never before using our advanced models. 

We are constructing a forex and crypto analysis platform built on Python, utilizing recent developments in time series predictive and generative models. Our goal is to detect micro-patterns in the markets, while combining fundamental and technical strategies, to suggest smartly informed trading decisions. While algorithmic and ML-aided trading continues to be explored, we hope this contributes towards creating stronger and profitable models. If you have any questions or would like to contribute, feel free to reach out!
